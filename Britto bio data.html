            <h3>Project Title: The Rise of Digital Marketing after COVID-19 Outbreak</h3>
            <p>The Covid-19 pandemic had an alarming impact on the business world. It changed our regular course of action when it forced us to stay indoors for an uncertain period. Businesses faced a sudden hit when they were forced to shut down. There were major losses for business owners in the absence of scope for going physically and selling their products. During the pandemic, while the world was on a halt, online usage gained momentum and digital marketing became an important aspect of the business world.

                The usage of online websites and social media platforms increased with the inception of the Covid-19 pandemic. It soon became a platform for customers to gain insights into the changes happening in the outside world. Taking advantage of these circumstances, businesses started adapting to the new normal by making use of the same social media as their platform to connect with their customers. Digital marketing became a crucial support for businesses to promote their products and stay in the minds of the customers. With the increased usage of online platforms and the sudden shift in the business world from offline to online, marketers took hold of digital marketing and continued to follow the digital path even after the pandemic came to an end.</p>
